### 🚀 About Me

I am a high-impact Full Stack Engineer specializing in bridging traditional backend systems (PostgreSQL, Redis) with cutting-edge AI tooling (MCP, Vercel AI SDK). 

Currently, I am a **Founding Engineer at Buildway.ai**, where I act as a solo lead on high-stakes billing and analytics systems. I thrive in high-velocity environments, shipping zero-downtime migrations and optimizing RAG pipelines for production.
